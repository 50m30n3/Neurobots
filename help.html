<h1>Help</h1>
<p>
I should really write something here.<br>
Until then, check out Wikipedias article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">artificial neural networks</a>.

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The brain options only take effect on newly added bots.</li>
	<li>The world options only take effect after a reset.</li>
	<li>Smaller brain size and complexity speeds up evolution but also limits the bots potential.</li>
	<li>Be aware that even with small brains it can take a really long time to see any development.</li>
	<li>You can control the view using your middle mouse button.</li>
	<li>Click on bots to view their stats and export their brain.</li>
	<li>To import a new brain select a bot, paste the brain data into the text box and press the "Inject!" button.</li>
	<li>You can use the "Save" button to save brain data locally.</li>
	<li>Increase the food respawn delay to force your bots to become better at finding food.</li>
</ul>
